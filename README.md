- [x] setup server + database
- [x] setup graphql

  - [x] `courses(limit, sortOrder)`: Returns a list of courses in the database. Accepts optional parameters `limit` (integer) and `sortOrder` (enum: `ASC` | `DESC`).
  - [x] `course(id)`: Returns the course with the specified `id`.
  - [x] `collections`: Returns a list of all course collections (categories).
  - [x] `collection(id)`: Returns a specific collection along with all contained courses.

  - [x] `addCourse(input)`: Adds a new course to the database.
  - [x] `updateCourse(id, input)`: Updates a course's details based on its ID.
  - [x] `deleteCourse(id)`: Deletes a course from the database by its ID.

- [ ] add authentication + authorization
  - [ ] `register(username, password)`: Allows users to create a new account.
  - [ ] `login(username, password)`: Authenticates users and returns an access token (JWT).
  - [ ] Protect the mutations (`addCourse`, `updateCourse`, and `deleteCourse`) so that only authenticated users with valid JWT tokens can perform these actions.

Bonus:

- [ ] Implement **role-based authorisation** (e.g., Admins can perform all actions, but regular users can only add or update their own courses).

# OSC Technical Assessment Submission - Moosa Shah

This assessment is designed to evaluate your technical proficiency in **TypeScript**, **Node.js**, **GraphQL**, and related backend technologies, as well as your ability to apply that knowledge to solve real-world problems.

### Instructions:

1.  You will be expected to write **clean**, **tested**, **well-documented**, and **efficient** code that meets the requirements of each part of the assessment.
2.  You may use any third-party libraries or tools you deem necessary to complete the assessment.
3.  You will be evaluated based on the **quality**, **readability**, and **maintainability** of your code.

### Part 1: API Development

You are tasked with developing a **GraphQL API** for Open Study College that allows internal users to retrieve and add data to a database of distance learning courses.

Your task is to build the following **GraphQL schema** and implement the associated **resolvers**.

#### Required Queries:

- [ ] `courses(limit, sortOrder)`: Returns a list of courses in the database. Accepts optional parameters `limit` (integer) and `sortOrder` (enum: `ASC` | `DESC`).
- [ ] `course(id)`: Returns the course with the specified `id`.
- [ ] `collections`: Returns a list of all course collections (categories).
- [ ] `collection(id)`: Returns a specific collection along with all contained courses.

#### Required Mutations:

- [ ] `addCourse(input)`: Adds a new course to the database.
- [ ] `updateCourse(id, input)`: Updates a course's details based on its ID.
- [ ] `deleteCourse(id)`: Deletes a course from the database by its ID.

#### Course Data Model:

The course data should include at least the following fields:

- ID
- Course Title
- Course Description
- Course Duration
- Course Outcome

You may use any database of your choice, although a form of SQL (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) would be preferable.

### Part 2: Authentication and Authorisation

Extend the GraphQL API developed in Part 1 to include **authentication** and **authorization** functionality. Users should authenticate using JWT tokens before performing any mutations (adding, updating, or deleting courses).

#### Required Authentication Flow:

- [ ] `register(username, password)`: Allows users to create a new account.
- [ ] `login(username, password)`: Authenticates users and returns an access token (JWT).
- [ ] Protect the mutations (`addCourse`, `updateCourse`, and `deleteCourse`) so that only authenticated users with valid JWT tokens can perform these actions.

#### Bonus:

- [ ] Implement **role-based authorisation** (e.g., Admins can perform all actions, but regular users can only add or update their own courses).

### Assessment Criteria:

- Your ability to design and develop a GraphQL API using TypeScript, Node.js and related technologies
- Your ability to configure and implement a working database.
- Your ability to implement **authentication** and **authorisation** using **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**
- Your understanding of **best practices** for writing clean, maintainable, and efficient code.
- Performance optimization of the GraphQL API (e.g., **batching** and **caching** queries).
