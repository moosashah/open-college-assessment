Improvements: 

Add tests - mock server/e2e test
Add health check endpoint
Better linting/typechecking
Add formatting (prettier)
Use husky -> run scritps on certain git hooks (before pushing branch to remote)
Use lintstaged/commitlint 
Add analytics (post hog)
Add monitoring/error tracking with sentry
Improve error responses


Production: 
local db for local dev (docker container) but in production -> RDS/Aurora/planetscale some manged DB service
Appsync - serverless graphql service
Auth: Auth0, Cognito, passport, workOS


Add CI - linting / running tests in PR/before commit - auto deploy when merge to main
	GitHub actions
    Code build
    Code pipeline
    circleCI
    Argocd

Callouts: 

updateCourse is a put (needs all fields) 
	Can change it to behave more like a patch

register mutation returns token as well as login
    Think this is more of a product decision whether user should register -> login to get token or register should do both
